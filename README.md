# C Piscine @ 42Adelaide

This repository contains coding developed at [42Adelaide's](https://www.42adel.org.au) C bootcamp (also known as `Piscine`), from 10/01/2022 to 06/02/2022.

## About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
	no classrooms, peer to peer learning.
	This methodology develops both coding and life skills. The 42 cursus is entirely free for everyone.
	The so-called "C Piscine" is a 28 day C programming bootcamp and is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a "cadet" (42's student).

## Skills developed at C Piscine

### Hard-skills
	# C Language
		The primary language learned at the 42's Piscine is C: dealing with variables, pointers, memory allocation, macros, as well as creating functions and programs, including the use and creation of libraries and Makefiles.
		During the Piscine you will be recreating a lot of the basic C functions.

	# Shell
		The first two days of the bootcamp are dedicated to learning basic to intermediate shell commands to seamlessly navigate through the terminal.

	# Git
		All projects are submitted via a remote git repository, which demands students be at ease with such a system.

### Soft-skills
	# Self-learning and proactiveness
		Self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There are no teachers, you will have to google everything, ask your fellow swimmers, and try (and fail, and try again), each student learning at their own pace.
		You are learning how to "figure shit out".

	# Teamwork
		On weekends, a 48h team project called "Rush" is proposed: a 3-member group randomly chosen by the school's system must collaboratively develop a fully running application.
		The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. You are free to work whenever you want, which demands excellent time management skills and resiliency to not
		"drown" in the massive load of work demanded by the Piscine.
